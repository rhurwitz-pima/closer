# closer

`closer` is a command-line application that streamlines the process of assessing student Class Learning Outcomes (CLOs) in eLumen.

Using a grade export from D2L, `closer` converts per-student CLO performance into a CSV file that can be imported directly into eLumen. This eliminates the need for instructors to manually enter CLO assessment results, reducing both time spent and the risk of data entry errors.

---

## Overview of the Workflow

Using `closer` involves three high-level steps:

1. Configure your D2L course shell so that each CLO is represented by a calculated grade item
2. Run `closer` to convert the D2L grade export into an eLumen-compatible CSV file
3. Import the generated CSV file into eLumen to record CLO assessment results

Each step is documented in detail in the how-to guides linked below.

## Prerequisites

Before using `closer`, your D2L course shell **must be configured with calculated grade items that represent each Course Learning Outcome (CLO)**.

Specifically:

- Each CLO must have a corresponding calculated grade item in D2L
- CLO grade items should aggregate scores from relevant assignments, quizzes, or discussions
- Only CLO grade items should be included when exporting grades from D2L

If your D2L gradebook is not configured this way, `closer` will not be able to process the exported grading file.

See: docs/howto/d2l-clo-setup.md

## Installation (uv)

`closer` is distributed via a GitHub repository and can be installed using **uv**, which automatically manages Python for you. No prior Python installation is required.

### Step 1: Install uv

For most users, the easiest way to install uv is via the official website:

https://astral.sh/uv

Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2: Install closer from GitHub

Once uv is installed, install `closer` as a standalone command-line tool directly from GitHub:

```bash
uv tool install "closer @ git+https://github.com/rhurwitz-pima/closer.git@main"
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
closer --version
```

## Basic Usage

To convert a D2L CLO grade export into an eLumen-ready CSV file:

```bash
closer d2l_export.csv elumen_import.csv
```

By default, `closer` evaluates CLO performance using a **70% passing threshold** and produces bi-modal results suitable for eLumen:

- ≥ 70% → Meets Expectations (1)
- < 70% → Does Not Meet Expectations (0)

To use a different passing threshold:

```bash
closer --threshold 75 d2l_export.csv elumen_import.csv
```

- docs/howto/importing-into-elumen.md

## Notes

- `closer` is designed for bi-modal CLO assessment models in eLumen (meets / does not meet expectations).
- The tool assumes that D2L grade exports follow the configuration described in the D2L setup guide.
- The CSV file generated by `closer` can be imported into eLumen without manual editing.
