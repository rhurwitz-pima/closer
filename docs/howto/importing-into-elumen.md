# Importing CLO Assessment Data into eLumen

This guide explains how to import a CSV file generated by `closer` into eLumen in order to record Class Learning Outcome (CLO) assessment results.

The steps below assume that:
- The assessment already exists in eLumen
- The assessment uses a **Scorecard** or **Rubric** scoring method
- Importing scores is enabled for your institution

---

## Prerequisites

Before importing:

- You have generated a CSV file using `closer`
- The CSV file contains:
  - A **Student ID** column
  - One column for **each CLO** in the assessment
- Your eLumen assessment includes **all CLOs** represented in the CSV

The CSV produced by `closer` is already structured to meet these requirements.

---

## CSV File Requirements

When importing scores into eLumen using a CSV file:

- The file must contain **one column identifying the student** (Student ID)
- The file must contain **one column per CLO**
- All CLO columns must be present
- All included students must have a value for every CLO

eLumen will:
- Ignore any extra columns in the CSV
- Allow one or more header rows
- Accept the following values for N/A:
  - `NA`, `N/A`, `na`, `n/a`, `-1`, or a blank cell

> Note: Because CSV files do not preserve formatting, there is no need to configure column types. Student IDs are imported as text.

---

## Step 1: Navigate to the Import Scores Tool

1. In eLumen, navigate to the course section containing the assessment.
2. Locate the assessment you want to score.
3. Select the **Import Scores** icon to the right of the assessment.

---

## Step 2: Upload the CSV File

1. Select **Choose File**.
2. Choose the CSV file generated by `closer`.
3. Select **Upload**.

eLumen will read the file and display the column alignment screen.

---

## Step 3: Align CSV Columns to CLOs

On the **Importing Scores** screen:

1. For **Student ID**, select the column in the CSV that contains student identifiers.
2. For each CLO:
   - Select the corresponding column from the CSV
   - Choose **Align selected column** for that CLO

As columns are aligned:
- eLumen lists them in the alignment panel
- Each aligned column is highlighted with a corresponding color

Continue until **all CLOs and the Student ID are aligned**.

---

## Step 4: Confirm and Import

After all required columns are aligned:

1. Review the alignment summary.
2. Proceed with the import.

The confirmation screen will display:
- The number of students whose scores were imported successfully

---

## Expected Result

After a successful import:

- Each student has a recorded score for every CLO in the assessment
- CLO results appear as **Meets Expectations (1)** or **Does Not Meet Expectations (0)**
- No manual data entry is required

---

## Notes and Caveats

- Extra columns in the CSV do not prevent import, as long as required columns are aligned
- Not all enrolled students must be included in the CSV
- All included students must have values for all CLOs
- For Activity-Oriented Assessments, eLumen may automatically apply recommended scores

To review or adjust individual scores after import, use the **Rubric View** or **Scorecard View**.

## Workflow Complete

At this point, the CLO assessment workflow is complete:

- D2L grades exported
- CLO performance evaluated by `closer`
- CLO results recorded in eLumen
