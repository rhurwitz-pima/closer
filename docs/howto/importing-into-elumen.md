# Importing CLO Assessment Data into eLumen

This guide explains how to import a CSV file generated by `closer` into eLumen in order to record Class Learning Outcome (CLO) assessment results.

Before proceeding, ensure that:

- You have used ```closer``` to convert a D2L grade export file into an eLumen CLO assessment import file as described in the [Using closer to Convert D2L CLO Exports](./using-closer.md) how-to document.

---

## Step 1: Navigate to the Import Scores Tool

1. In eLumen, navigate to the course section containing the assessment.
0. Locate the assessment you want to score.
0. Select the **Import Scores** icon to the right of the assessment.

---

## Step 2: Upload the CSV File

1. Select **Choose File**.
0. Choose the CSV file generated by `closer`.
0. Select **Upload**.

eLumen will read the file and display the column alignment screen.

---

## Step 3: Align CSV Columns to CLOs

On the **Importing Scores** screen:

1. For **Student ID**, select the column in the CSV that contains student identifiers. This column should be labeled as **SID**
0. For each CLO:
   Select the corresponding column from the CSV. These columns should be labeled as **CLO_1**, **CLO_2**, etc.

As columns are aligned:
- eLumen lists them in the alignment panel
- Each aligned column is highlighted with a corresponding color

Continue until **all CLOs and the Student ID are aligned**.

---

## Step 4: Confirm and Import

After all required columns are aligned:

1. Review the alignment summary.
2. Proceed with the import.

The confirmation screen will display:
- The number of students whose scores were imported successfully

---

## Expected Result

After a successful import:

- Each student has a recorded score for every CLO in the assessment
- CLO results appear as **Meets Expectations (1)** or **Does Not Meet Expectations (0)**
- No manual data entry is required. To review or adjust individual scores after import, use the **Rubric View** or **Scorecard View**.

## Workflow Complete

At this point, the CLO assessment workflow is complete:

- D2L grades exported
- CLO performance evaluated by `closer`
- CLO results recorded in eLumen
